# 🧺 BasketOptimization

**BasketOptimization** is a forecasting and decision-support tool inspired by real-world insights from in-basket shoppers in the **hospitality and foodservice industry**. It blends statistical modeling and industry-specific heuristics to help optimize product mix, pricing, and bundling strategies.

---

## 💡 Motivation

This project was driven by the observation that **in-basket shoppers** (e.g., restaurant buyers, catering managers, institutional chefs) hold valuable knowledge about purchase behavior, seasonal trends, and margin sensitivity. By combining this knowledge with **mathematical statistics and forecasting models**, BasketOptimization aims to:

- Predict the **optimal product mix** per customer segment  
- Suggest **profitable bundling strategies** (e.g., food + non-food + logistics)  
- Simulate **price elasticity and demand shifts** under inflationary pressures  
- Guide **decision-makers** on how to package offerings to improve customer retention and increase revenue
